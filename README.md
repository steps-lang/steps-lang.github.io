## Welcome to STEPS

### SYNOPSIS
STEPS is the acronym for **S**tatically **T**yped **E**ducational **P**rogramming **S**ystem. STEPS is still work in progress (**WIP**), there is no fully functional implementation yet.

STEPS covers some ideas of providing a language which is simple enough to be used in teaching a beginners course in programming aimed at students
in secondary or higher education while being powerful enough to cover topics of more advanced and applied programming courses, such as computational
physics, algebra, numerics, etc.

### What STEPS is not
- STEPS is not aimed at primary education. The requirements for primary schools are quite different from secondary and higher education.
- STEPS tries to cover a wide range of applications but most people would not call it a general-purpose language.
  Currently there are no plans to provide a foreign function interface (FFI) or any other kind of interoperability.
  Furthermore, I have no experience how the language features and the performance scale when it comes to very large software projects.
